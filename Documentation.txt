Packages guide:

nodemon is to not have to start and stop the server repeatedly during development. The server will
automatically see change and update

concurrently: is a package that we use to create the script "dev": where we run back and front end
server in 1 script

dotenv: is a package to get environment variables from an .env file into process.env

Random Explanation:

The const something = require('something package'); is old syntax
we can use es modules style in newer version of nodejs (from node 14.6)
Have to put {"type":"module"} in package.json
NOTE: if import a file not a package => need to add .js behind it 
module.exports change into export default for files
